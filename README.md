# Diluted Band Website

### Getting Started

Install Dependencies

```
yarn install
```

#### Developing locally

In your CLI run the follow (order should not matter)

```
yarn run build
```

This will set a watch on the src/app.js folder and output the translated code to public/scripts/app.js. Then run the following...

```
yarn run serve
```

A browser should automatically open with the app!
